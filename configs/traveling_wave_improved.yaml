# Improved Traveling Wave Configuration
#
# KEY IMPROVEMENT: Significantly increased ic_velocity weight to enforce
# zero initial velocity condition, addressing the wave-splitting issue
# identified by Gemini AI.
#
# PROBLEM: With zero initial velocity, d'Alembert solution splits the wave
# into two half-amplitude waves. PINN struggles to learn this without strong
# enforcement of the initial velocity condition.
#
# SOLUTION: Increase ic_velocity weight from 100.0 to 500.0
